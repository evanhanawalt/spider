## Spider

I made a spider graph/ radar chart with react, tailwindcss, trigonometry, and the svg element.

My implementation is obviously very rough, and not super reusable, but if I wanted to use it in the future this is an okay starting point on which to cusomize/optimize/parameterize a similar chart that can occomodate a different inputs (if needed).

run locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

build:

```
npm install
npm run build
```
